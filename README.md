Filament plugin for archiving and unarchiving table records (eloquent models) based on the [Laravel Archivable package by Joe Butcher](https://github.com/joelbutcher/laravel-archivable). 

This filament plugin adds an [ArchiveAction](#archiveunarchive-actions), an [UnArchiveAction](#archiveunarchive-actions) and a [ArchivedFilter](#filtering) to your resource tables. It's also possible to [add custom row-classes for archived records](#add-custom-classes-to-archived-rows). In addition to table-actions, the package provides also page-actions for view/edit pages to archive and unarchive your records.

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.3
- Laravel ^11.0
- Filament ^3.0
- Laravel Archivable ^1.4 (installed with this plugin)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require okeonline/filament-archivable
```

Then, add the plugin to the ```AppPanelProvider```:

```php
class AppPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            // ...
            ->plugin(\Okeonline\FilamentArchivable\FilamentArchivablePlugin::make());
    }
}
```

This filament plugin automatically installs the [Laravel Archivable package by Joe Butcher](https://github.com/joelbutcher/laravel-archivable).

Follow his installation instructions, which -in short- instructs:

1) Add a ```archived_at``` column to your table
2) Use the ```Archivable```-trait on your model

## Usage

### Archive and UnArchive table actions
As soon as the ```Archivable```-trait from the [Laravel Archivable package](#installation) is added to the model, it is possible to add the following actions to the corresponding resource table:

```php

use Okeonline\FilamentArchivable\Tables\Actions\ArchiveAction;
use Okeonline\FilamentArchivable\Tables\Actions\UnArchiveAction;
// ...

class UserResource extends Resource
{
    // ...
    public static function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            // ...
            ->actions([
                ArchiveAction::make(),
                UnArchiveAction::make(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

It will show the ```ArchiveAction``` on records that aren't archived, and will show the ```UnArchiveAction``` on those which are currently archived:

![Actions](https://github.com/okeonline/filament-archivable/raw/main/assets/screen-actions.png)

> You should add **both** actions to the same table. The action itself wil determine if it should be shown on the record.

The actions are normal **table** actions, similar to the [Delete](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/actions/prebuilt-actions/delete) and [Restore](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/actions/prebuilt-actions/restore) table actions of FilamentPHP. You can add all features that are described in the [FilamentPHP Table Actions Documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/tables/actions), like:

- ```hiddenLabel()```
- ```tooltip()```
- ```disabled()```
- ```icon()```
- ... etc.

```php
ArchiveAction::make()
    ->hiddenLabel()
    ->tooltip('Archive'),
```

The table actions call the ```$model->archive()```  and ```$model->unArchive()``` methods that are provided by the [Laravel Achivable package](https://github.com/joelbutcher/laravel-archivable?tab=readme-ov-file#extensions).

### Archive and UnArchive page actions
As soon as the ```Archivable```-trait from the [Laravel Archivable package](#installation) is added to the model, it is possible to add the following actions to the resource **pages**:

```php
// in e.g. Filament/PostResource/EditPage.php
use Okeonline\FilamentArchivable\Actions\ArchiveAction;
use Okeonline\FilamentArchivable\Actions\UnArchiveAction;

// ...
protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        ArchiveAction::make(),
        UnArchiveAction::make(),
    ];
}
```

It will show the ```ArchiveAction``` on records that aren't archived, and will show the ```UnArchiveAction``` on those which are currently archived:

> Be aware that there is a difference between **table** actions and **normal (page)** actions. You can not use the page actions as a table action, vice versa. Nevertheless, the business-logic is the same. *Read [this page](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/actions/overview) for more information about the difference.*

> You should add **both** actions to the same page. The action itself wil determine if it should be shown on the record. Check [this](#add-custom-classes-to-archived-rows) if you want to edit (and unarchive) records that are being archived.

The actions are normal actions, similar to the [Delete](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/actions/prebuilt-actions/delete) and [Restore](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/actions/prebuilt-actions/restore) actions of FilamentPHP. You can add all features that are described in the [FilamentPHP Actions Documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/actions/overview), like:

- ```color()```
- ```size()```
- ```disabled()```
- ```icon()```
- ... etc.

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\ActionSize;

ArchiveAction::make()
    ->color('success')
    ->size(ActionSize::Large),
```

### Filtering

It is also possible to add a ```ArchivedFilter``` to the resoucre table, which adds three filtering options:
- Show only unarchived records
- Show only archived records
- Show both
   
> By default, an unfiltered table will only show the unarchived records, as the Laravel Archivable package comes with a default global scope to query records with ```archived_at IS NULL```

You can add the filter by adding ```ArchivedFilter``` to your array of resource table filters:

```php
use Okeonline\FilamentArchivable\Tables\Filters\ArchivedFilter;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        // ...
        ->filters([
            ArchivedFilter::make(),
        ]);
}
```

![Filters](https://github.com/okeonline/filament-archivable/raw/main/assets/screen-filters.png)

The ```ArchivedFilter``` will respect all options that Tenary Filters have, so check the [Tenary Filter Documentation of Filament](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/tables/filters/ternary) to customize the filter.

#### Ability to view/edit/delete archived records
If you want to be able to view/edit/delete archived records, you should disable the global ```ArchivedScope::class``` on your resource ``` getEloquentQuery()``` method:

```php
// in your resource:
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;
use LaravelArchivable\Scopes\ArchivableScope; 

public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()
        ->withoutGlobalScopes([
            SoftDeletingScope::class, // only if soft deleting is also active, otherwise it can be ommitted
            ArchivableScope::class,
        ]);
}
```
See [Disabeling global scopes on Filament](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/resources/getting-started#disabling-global-scopes) for more information about the default resource query.

### Add custom classes to archived rows

This plugin comes with a ```Table::macro``` which allows you to add custom (CSS/Tailwind) classes to ***table-rows** that are archived*:

Just add the method ```->archivedRecordClasses()``` to your table with archived results.

```php
public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->archivedRecordClasses(['opacity-25']);
}
```
